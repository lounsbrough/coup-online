## Do you want to change the translation directly?

You can do so here:
  - [client translations](/client/src/i18n/translations.ts)
  - [server translations](/server/src/i18n/translations.ts)

## Otherwise, let us know what text is wrong:

**What language has the incorrect translation?**
Ex. US-English, India-Hindi, etc.

**What is the current translation that is incorrect?**
```txt
<current text>
```

**What should the translation say instead?**
```txt
<suggested text>
```
